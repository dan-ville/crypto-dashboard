# Crypto Dashboard
Crypto converter and news feed

> This was a guided project

Learned how to retrieve data from alpha-vantage api to perform conversion operations and retrieve data from crypto-news to generate a small news feed. 

**Main takeaway**: 
Learned how to create a small, simple back-end for this react project in order to hide the API key consumed from the front-end client.
